## Accumulated Decisions

| Phase | Decision | Rationale |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| 01-01 | Logo as separate TS module | 85KB base64 too large for inline embedding |
| 01-01 | Strapline in PDF header | "Doing good by doing well" adds brand identity |
| 01-02 | Logo-only on admin pages | Strapline optional for internal pages - keeps UI cleaner |
| 01-02 | Group name on company-facing pages only | BRAND-03 requirement - network identification for external users |
| 02-01 | Helper functions in public schema | auth schema requires elevated permissions |
| 02-01 | JWT claim decoding in AuthContext | Custom claims from hook go to JWT payload, not app_metadata |
| 02-03 | RLS policies use public.is_admin() | Consistent with public schema helper functions |
| 03-01 | Qualitative fields required in unified form | Companies must self-assess - not optional like old consultant flow |
| 03-02 | Route path /company/:businessId/submit | Distinguishes company-facing routes from admin /business/ routes |
| 04-01 | Use Zod v4 .issues for error handling | Zod v4 changed error structure from .errors to .issues |
| 04-01 | All financial fields optional in import schema | Historical data may be incomplete (sales from 2021, EBITDA from 2025) |
| 04-02 | Upsert with onConflict data_request_id | Allows re-running import to update existing months |
| 04-02 | submitted_by_name = 'Historical Import' | Clear audit trail for imported vs submitted data |

## Blockers

None currently.

## Session Continuity

**Last session:** 2026-02-02
**Stopped at:** Completed 04-02-PLAN.md
**Resume file:** None

## Next Action

Proceed to Phase 4 Plan 3 (if exists) or Phase 5 (Reporting).

Key deliverables from Phase 4 Plan 2:
- Admin import page at /admin/import
- Drag-drop file upload with react-dropzone
- Column detection and preview table
- Business name matching with unmatched highlighting
- Bulk upsert to data_requests and company_submissions
- Progress tracking during import
- Historical data now visible in scorecards

Data import workflow complete - Chester admins can self-service upload Shane's historical Excel data.
