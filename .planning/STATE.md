## Accumulated Decisions

| Phase | Decision | Rationale |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| 01-01 | Logo as separate TS module | 85KB base64 too large for inline embedding |
| 01-01 | Strapline in PDF header | "Doing good by doing well" adds brand identity |
| 01-02 | Logo-only on admin pages | Strapline optional for internal pages - keeps UI cleaner |
| 01-02 | Group name on company-facing pages only | BRAND-03 requirement - network identification for external users |
| 02-01 | Helper functions in public schema | auth schema requires elevated permissions |
| 02-01 | JWT claim decoding in AuthContext | Custom claims from hook go to JWT payload, not app_metadata |
| 02-03 | RLS policies use public.is_admin() | Consistent with public schema helper functions |
| 03-01 | Qualitative fields required in unified form | Companies must self-assess - not optional like old consultant flow |
| 03-02 | Route path /company/:businessId/submit | Distinguishes company-facing routes from admin /business/ routes |

## Blockers
