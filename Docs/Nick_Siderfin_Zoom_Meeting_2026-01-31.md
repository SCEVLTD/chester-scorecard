## Transcript

dylan shaw - 00:00
Good.

Nick Siderfin - 00:05
Scott likes his note- take it, which is good.

dylan shaw - 00:10
A bit of AI.

Nick Siderfin - 00:14
Morning, Joe.
Morning, you're right.

dylan shaw - 00:20
Morning,

Nick Siderfin - 00:25
good day to you.
Morning, morning,

Scott Markham - 00:28
morning.
Good morning.
Good morning.
I

Nick Siderfin - 00:32
hope Scott doesn't charge us too much overtime for this.

Scott Markham - 00:36
That time and a half.

dylan shaw - 00:39
Yeah, time and

Scott Markham - 00:41
half and double time on Sundays.

Nick Siderfin - 00:44
This meeting is being recorded.
We'll certainly be avoiding.

Scott Markham - 00:51
Yeah.

Nick Siderfin - 00:53
There's your AI

dylan shaw - 00:54
tool, Scott.
Can you make it generate preachings and stuff?
I

Scott Markham - 00:59
can't tell you too much, can I.

Nick Siderfin - 01:02
Scott doesn't need that.
I can take it offline,

Scott Markham - 01:04
Dylan.

Nick Siderfin - 01:07
That is double money.
Very

dylan shaw - 01:13
good.
Well, I sent

Nick Siderfin - 01:16
Scott a few notes about the Chester situation and how this tool might work.
Obviously the tool we were working on, which I showed you very briefly.
whatever it was Wednesday or Tuesday was more for UBT and businesses, but I did actually say, Scott, yesterday I did just wonder whether this is actually quite a good sort of a test run for it.
So I think you've got the gist of what we're trying to do pretty much, Scott.

Scott Markham - 01:48
Yeah, I mean, John, we've got much time.

Nick Siderfin - 01:51
We've only got this next week to sort of sort it

dylan shaw - 01:57
Yeah, that's the challenge is we've got this meeting on Friday with all the businesses and if we're going to get any feedback from them or any data back from them and have time to have looked at that and give and sort of put our heads together and thought about it.
There's not a lot of time left.

Nick Siderfin - 02:18
So anyway, far away, Scotland.
So

Scott Markham - 02:22
just to be clear then, you would like to be able to send something out for to all the businesses before next Friday, have that data back and be able to analyze it for the meeting next Friday.

Nick Siderfin - 02:33
Yeah.
Okay,

Scott Markham - 02:36
no pressure from my side.
I

Nick Siderfin - 02:39
got Sunday.
Yeah,

Scott Markham - 02:42
and that's double time.
But yeah, no, I, that's That's doable as long as I have some complete clarity from your side as to what you want from it.
I can show you what we've got already from the UBT side of things and how that's on the UBT example scorecard I've built I've put sort of say six months fake data in to the system over for about four companies so that you can see how that is panning out what it's producing and then from the details
that obviously the information I've had from Nick so far You're wanting things like adding EBITDAR, which is fine.
It's just another point.
The subscription logo side of things just need a little bit more information around that to see what you're wanting because it sounds like you've got two sorts of elements you've got like the You want some hidden you don't some things being visible so companies can't necessarily see
who's doing what and what's, or

dylan shaw - 03:45
who's doing whatever.
Yeah,

Scott Markham - 03:48
about some having some logos and things on there, um, which is all possible.

Nick Siderfin - 03:52
And also, yeah, we can send reminders,

Scott Markham - 03:55
no problem, like how often, how often you want the reminders to go out for them

dylan shaw - 04:00
to fill in the link.
They fill in the

Nick Siderfin - 04:03
words, Scott, just before, so too much more.
There's a little PowerPoint that, um, Chester put together.

Scott Markham - 04:11
Do you think that might set

Nick Siderfin - 04:12
the scene, Dylan.
Yeah, yeah, that's good idea.

dylan shaw - 04:15
And also, just to give you a bit of background, Scott, we already gather data from the businesses, which Shane does, which is done through a Microsoft form, just manually.
We asked for kind of a bit dark, turnover, etc.
And

Nick Siderfin - 04:31
one of the things that's really important is just confidentiality

dylan shaw - 04:34
that people don't feel like everybody can see this data.
Yeah.
Yeah, if nobody could see the individual data, it would actually probably give a lot more confidence to it.
But let me just quickly whistle through that PowerPoint.
If I could pull it up in short order.
Where did I stick it?
I

dylan shaw - 05:06
think it's this.
Let me just share my screen.
Tell me if that's sharing.
Something's

Scott Markham - 05:24
starting.
Yep.
Okay.

dylan shaw - 05:29
So 19 businesses locally.
This was the context for this meeting that we're having, which is Nick's kind of agreed to come along to and Mike Simpson's coming to, which is some feedback that Darrell Newton got from having a meeting with Dean Hales when he was in Sydney, which was about just getting an external chair in and
pumping the businesses up.

Scott Markham - 05:54
Yeah.
That's

dylan shaw - 05:56
a bit of a strap line that we're following, which is what Mr. Taylor said to us in 2009

Scott Markham - 06:01
in the meeting.

dylan shaw - 06:04
This was a schedule of meeting, so probably not relevant, but this is the aggregated data that Shane's collecting from all the businesses, um, each month, which is just the EBITDA.
This was a question that we put out to them in the last meeting is can we find like a common metric that we can measure across all the businesses, which is more of a lead measure rather than a kind of a lag measure.

Scott Markham - 06:32
Yeah.
This is what probably made me think of

Nick Siderfin - 06:35
you, Scott, when we, because this was my goal, wasn't it?

Scott Markham - 06:38
Yeah.
That's sort of one number.

dylan shaw - 06:41
So yeah.
And then the presentation this next Friday, this was the kind of format that we originally were thinking that because there's 20 businesses and it's time is, we haven't got massive amount of time.
It would be 10 minutes per business and it'd be like, what's key wins you're having, what's the key blockers to your growth?
What can we come up with as a team around the table to help?
Then

Nick Siderfin - 07:06
what are the actions out of it?
But if we got to do all that information and we'll already be there, wouldn't it pretty

dylan shaw - 07:11
much.
Yeah, yeah, so that's the benefit of doing what, if we went down this route, we would sort of have collected the data already, thought about it, and then have, rather than spending time trying to absorb information, we're just spending the time coming up with the ideas and sharing them.
We've put together a bit of good feedback on that meeting, and then, yeah, there's a bit of a wrap-up, but Anyway, you've got any extra comments, Shane, from what we're trying to achieve.

Shane McEwan - 07:44
No, I think that PowerPoint really summarizes it, doesn't it?
I think, like you said before, in terms of the data, we sort of managed to start capturing the data that year 18 months ago on the basis that it was fairly hidden in that sense, and we've reported on.
this sort of consolidated report each month since.
So we've got quite a bit of back data.
We've got from 2021 in sales and John 25 in EBDAR for the majority.
So it's just a question of getting that, trying to pull some sort of structure together to make that usable in it for us still really.

dylan shaw - 08:26
Yeah, yeah.
It's quite sensitive subject, didn't it?
Like people think that you're telling them the kind of pants size when to sharing data like this.
But you've got to respect it because otherwise you won't get it.
That's

Shane McEwan - 08:42
the trouble.
And I feel we have got that respect now.
We're getting the data in, but we don't want to

Nick Siderfin - 08:51
break that, do we?
No.
I think it's amazing that you've got as far as you have, because I don't know that many localities would be prepared to do that.

dylan shaw - 09:02
But it does help when Dean Hale says to someone in the place that all he looks at is a bit dark.

Nick Siderfin - 09:07
Yeah.

Scott Markham - 09:13
Okay.
That's it.
Yeah, there's been some good progress,

Shane McEwan - 09:15
isn't it?
It's just getting to the next point and getting to the next level and material to make it useful.
I

dylan shaw - 09:21
mean, our key game, our key aim for the next five days, we just want to add as much value as we can and get ramp things up because we've got lots of tiny little businesses and a handful of small, medium- size businesses and we haven't got any big businesses in Jester.
So it's just about trying to get things wrapped up.
So there's some prosperity in the place and we can employ people because we've got people out of jobs and things like that.

Scott Markham - 09:47
Yeah, okay.
Okay, so there was on that form, on that table you showed there's about four questions, wasn't there?

dylan shaw - 09:56
Yeah.
Which obviously

Scott Markham - 09:59
are the key ones you want to gather and see information from.

dylan shaw - 10:02
Yeah.
You've got a lot of the figures

Scott Markham - 10:05
already is what you say, Shane?
Yeah, that's right, yeah.
So it kind of just needs to be pulled in together for a school card and also maybe some summaries that can help whoever's on that team beforehand looking at each to give you some guidance and maybe some numbers, as you say, Nick, that scores them to see where they're whether progressing or not
progressing.
Obviously, we can click that.
We can pull that data in from what you've got already from a growth EBITDA section, you may already be, do you already report on that as a number or not?

Shane McEwan - 10:47
We report each month we send a report around a consolidated report, yeah.

Scott Markham - 10:52
Yeah.
So they're used to seeing something already.

Shane McEwan - 10:55
Yeah.
I guess we want to make it simple

Nick Siderfin - 10:59
really, don't we don't.
Yeah, clear and concise.

dylan shaw - 11:02
Yeah, simple, easy to fill out.
And the heavy lifting of reminding is done by the system rather than by Shane getting frustrated on a Friday night after two scotches.

Scott Markham - 11:15
That definitely wouldn't happen,

Shane McEwan - 11:19
Bill.
They don't like scotch.

Scott Markham - 11:24
That's fine.
And if it comes from, say, like,

Nick Siderfin - 11:27
Chester reporting, it's different from

Scott Markham - 11:29
coming from a person, if you know what I mean?
Yeah.
And it can be, you know, it's the software doing it that they don't have to know I'm behind it even, do you know what I mean?
And I happily sign an NDA as required between you and the Chester team as required, if that's applicable and would help.
Yeah.

dylan shaw - 11:53
Is it possible to do it in a way that actually an individual can't see the data.
It can only be aggregated data.

Scott Markham - 12:02
Yeah.
So we can we can set different levels.
So companies can see their own data.

dylan shaw - 12:07
Yeah.
But but not anybody

Scott Markham - 12:10
else's.
Okay.
And they can then see the aggregated data as applicable.
Depending on what those metrics you want to show.

dylan shaw - 12:20
Yes.
Okay.
The

Scott Markham - 12:23
most common challenge this month is, or overall the challenges are.

dylan shaw - 12:29
And it just puts it into a kind of AI summary, if you know

Scott Markham - 12:32
what I mean?
The wins this month have been these type of things and going forward.
Yeah, the summary overall for the month is.
And that would all just create every time.
That's

dylan shaw - 12:46
basically what we want to do.
Just if we've got a format that we can just put on a screen and run through.
It's kind of done all the work for us, and it's just,

Scott Markham - 12:55
we've got, we're just brainstorming it then,

dylan shaw - 12:59
don't we?
Yeah.
The other thing that might be just helpful just is the form that you've sent around that you've been using already.
Shane, just to collect that data.
I'll just quickly share it.
It's got it open here.
Sat sharing.

Scott Markham - 13:24
So this is just a Microsoft form.

dylan shaw - 13:25
So just rate the meeting.
Explain your answer.
What's the key topic that you've got a challenge with?
What is the challenge that the specific challenge?
And then there's this about what was the what's the key KPI that we could use that you could use in the business that we could measure.
than anything else.
So that's what we just sent out just to collect the data.

Nick Siderfin - 13:55
Which is all sort of been captured anyway, isn't it?
On what Scott's doing.

dylan shaw - 14:00
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
What Scott's doing will replace that.

Shane McEwan - 14:04
Yeah, just so you had a bit of context as to what

dylan shaw - 14:07
we'd already done.
But how many people actually responded to that, Shane?

Shane McEwan - 14:11
I think latest was, you know, Not everyone.
I think it's a bit difficult.
We've got one or two quite small businesses and we deal.

dylan shaw - 14:23
Yeah, one month balance, yeah.
Yeah, I think they sort

Shane McEwan - 14:28
of 14 we've got, but some of them are duplicates in terms of one or two in the businesses have responded.

dylan shaw - 14:34
Okay.
Yeah.
So I'm, have

Shane McEwan - 14:38
a look, I think it's approximately 10 businesses have responded out of their 19.

dylan shaw - 14:43
Okay.
I mean, will

Nick Siderfin - 14:46
you talk to some of the other ones, I mean, it doesn't really matter too much about some of the very small ones, does it, but you would, you normally have the bigger ones responding, haven't you?

Shane McEwan - 14:56
Yes, yeah, definitely the sort key movers, yeah, as we stand currently.

Scott Markham - 15:03
And you've got a different form for the figures.

Shane McEwan - 15:06
Yeah, we just have fairly straightforward form for figures.
Is it

dylan shaw - 15:13
just revenue, habit die you're collecting?
A forecast or budget.

Shane McEwan - 15:20
So basically what?
I'll just share this and you see there.
That's what we collect.
That's what we send out each month just to collect sales and nibbit die.
And then I've just done this year well, the last week I've sent one out for 2026 targets of sales on EBDAR targets.
That's very basic elementary stuff really that form.

dylan shaw - 16:05
Yeah.

Scott Markham - 16:10
Okay.

dylan shaw - 16:12
I don't know how clear we've made it, Scott, have we just completely muddied the waters and sort of made it impossible build.

Scott Markham - 16:22
No, no, it's not impossible at all.
What would make it possible is if I could have access to those forms, or if you could share those forms with me and the data so that we're not, we can get to the point we need to as fast as possible for the meeting next Friday.
Okay.

dylan shaw - 16:38
There's no point recollecting data if we've already got it.

Scott Markham - 16:40
And then, And then after that, by sort of Monday night, say, I can share you what I've managed to build and put together for your comment.

dylan shaw - 16:55
That one I just chucked on the chat was the one- off one that we did for this meeting next Friday.
If you want to put the other one on, Shane, that was the monthly one.

Scott Markham - 17:03
And do these have access to the data as well?
Do you want me to?

Shane McEwan - 17:09
Yeah, I can, you can just download them into an Excel.
So I can ping them across to you.

Scott Markham - 17:15
Perfect.
Do you mean the actual data has been filled in?

dylan shaw - 17:18
Yeah.

Shane McEwan - 17:25
Yeah, that's easy enough.
I'll say I'll ping them across on the email.
I think I've got your email from the Outlook appointments.

Scott Markham - 17:29
You should have it from the Outlook appointment, yeah.
So what,

dylan shaw - 17:32
Scott, will it be like a browser-based, like just username and login that

Scott Markham - 17:36
you?
Yeah.
Okay.
And is it,

dylan shaw - 17:40
I'm just thinking forward a little bit because If you've said, Shane, that two or three people from the same business have filled them in.
Does that something we need to build into it so that it's got a common kind of thing, like the company name, but going to the common component.

Shane McEwan - 17:55
Yeah, it's a good idea because I'm not sure on that one.
We've got a company name.
I wish I could just add that into the spreadsheet before I send

Scott Markham - 18:03
Yeah, fine.
Yeah, I mean, we could have one.
It could potentially only allow one per domain if that makes sense.
One user per domain.

dylan shaw - 18:11
Yeah, or, or when they log in, they see, both see the same.

Scott Markham - 18:16
Yeah, exactly.
And, and therefore it would say it's already been completed.

dylan shaw - 18:19
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah,

Scott Markham - 18:23
you can do that.

dylan shaw - 18:26
Sounds good.
That would be good then, don't want it, because then we could

Shane McEwan - 18:28
just sort of run a bit of a campaign locally

dylan shaw - 18:32
through the week to capture whatever we need.
Yeah.

Shane McEwan - 18:37
I've found over the last few months in collecting this data that just gentle messages every day at a certain time just seems to eventually they just realize that you're

dylan shaw - 18:49
not going anywhere you're not going away to be

Shane McEwan - 18:52
honest but they realize eventually they're gonna have to do it yeah

Scott Markham - 18:57
and it's for their good isn't it it's not yeah that is the only outcome

Shane McEwan - 19:01
I don't think in reality in the majority I don't think we've got a problem with it it's just everyone's busy,

dylan shaw - 19:07
so I just try and I've tried

Shane McEwan - 19:10
different times of the day to see when's best.
Early mornings I've found is the most responsive so.

Nick Siderfin - 19:19
The actual data that you're working through on the
tweets on that.

Scott Markham - 19:38
I think for next Friday, we just need to focus on exactly what you're already focusing on and you've got in that presentation.
We can build it out if there's further elements that need building out over the next months.
that make sense?
Is that fair?
There's no point now.
Yeah,

Nick Siderfin - 19:55
exactly.
But I mean, if you've already, what you've already developed to me is, you know, in order to sort of go changing it unduly.
So

Scott Markham - 20:03
I can change the questions.
And then the scoring will match the new questions if that makes sense.

Nick Siderfin - 20:11
Yes, I'm just wondering whether we're happy with what you've already got rather than having to change it.
I mean, do we want to just spin through that again?
Or because we didn't we haven't exactly spent a lot of time pairing those questions.
Have we just done it as a bit of a trial, really?

dylan shaw - 20:31
Are they things that can be turned on and off?
Like, can you just turn on, like a slider that you turn on that question or turn it off again.

Scott Markham - 20:39
It's not like that at the moment.
It's still fairly, fairly new, but it is flexible in what I can do with it, if you know what

Nick Siderfin - 20:48
I mean?
So,

Scott Markham - 20:51
go No, I just say, they're very good questions, but I

dylan shaw - 20:54
almost wonder whether we need to get to a point where you've got some momentum from businesses filling stuff in before we start overloading them with, like, here's another data dump of 20 questions.

Scott Markham - 21:06
Yeah, I think, I suppose the only thing is if we could

Nick Siderfin - 21:09
put an email message around to the business owners, that the whole idea of this
difficult to fit in.

dylan shaw - 21:32
Yeah, 10 minutes work.
Well, apart from the numbers,

Nick Siderfin - 21:34
possibly, but you're going to do that anyway.
The numbers is

Scott Markham - 21:37
the longest time.
The rest of it are basically multiple choice and then.

Nick Siderfin - 21:40
Yeah, it's dead easy.
But what I'm saying are we, you know, if there was a fundamental problem with one of the aggressions, we might as well fix it now.

dylan shaw - 21:52
Do you want to, um, do you want to share the link, Scott, and we can, go through it and just give any feedback or...

Nick Siderfin - 22:01
Or we could do it now.
Yeah, either way.
Whatever, Scott, reverse.

Scott Markham - 22:06
Let me...

dylan shaw - 22:12
Was it written in, Scott?

Scott Markham - 22:15
What do you mean?
Is it... Is it written in

dylan shaw - 22:17
kind of code or... Yeah.
As in NAN or...

Scott Markham - 22:23
No.
There's no NAN in this.
It's all... It's all, it's all been scripted and Python code, et cetera.

Nick Siderfin - 22:33
Fair enough.
So do we put, can we put velocity on the top then?

Scott Markham - 22:38
Yeah, so at the top, we could have philosophy that that, I don't know, can you share that PowerPoint with me, please.

dylan shaw - 22:44
Yeah.
We could have, so

Scott Markham - 22:46
I can take the logo and set, please.
So it will look like Chester's.

Nick Siderfin - 22:50
Yeah, perfect.
Scorecard.
um

Scott Markham - 22:54
and then you can for the businesses we can put them all in or whether you want to put them in you can just add a business just simply by adding that and then if you edit it you can set what sector it's in so you've got that data as well so you've got some data to look at when the sectors compare
against different sectors I don't know what sectors you have locally but That can all be easily added.
And
what happens typically is you request the data.
So if we go to, I don't know, June 25. Are

Nick Siderfin - 23:42
we going to bother with historic data?

Scott Markham - 23:45
I'm just doing this for this demo.

Nick Siderfin - 23:47
Yeah.
because in theory if

Scott Markham - 23:50
I've got that data already it will make the scorecard look a lot better already so if that's what I get from Shane I can add that in at the beginning and therefore you will have more but typically they'll get something like this per month where they can they can fill in

dylan shaw - 24:15
and will it remember like if you because how we've done it now so far is we've done the target as we've collected it like now for the whole year for each month

Scott Markham - 24:27
yeah okay so we can have that so it's stored in it's stored

dylan shaw - 24:32
yeah

Scott Markham - 24:47
Can

dylan shaw - 24:47
we change net profit to have it done.
Yeah.

Scott Markham - 24:54
And then at the moment, which where some of the change might be is that at the moment, this is just things from the business that they would fill in, which could be the four questions that you just had.

dylan shaw - 25:11
Yeah.
Very similar, aren't they?

Scott Markham - 25:16
Yeah.
Um,

Nick Siderfin - 25:24
what's the new customer?

Scott Markham - 25:30
Once that's submitted,
you can create the scorecard.
So if you go back to that, where was that warrant test.

Nick Siderfin - 25:51
Is that the It was on.
Come on, what day you put in there.
did

Scott Markham - 25:58
not.
Okay, so that's the card I just submitted.
Great scorecard and it's given it a score of 36. This in theory what the consultant would fill out, but this is what the customer could have these sections on, which also give the score.
So is a leadership, I mean, depends on how much information they want to share.
So you've got minor issues, market demand, there's mixed signals.

dylan shaw - 26:53
Yeah.

Scott Markham - 27:12
And in theory, we've done, they would have done this bit already.

dylan shaw - 27:17
So are we talking about, we combine that first bit and this screen together into one.
That's

Scott Markham - 27:21
what I'm thinking, yeah.
And

dylan shaw - 27:26
then almost to what you've then got is third layer, which is just aggregated.

Scott Markham - 27:30
Yeah.

dylan shaw - 27:40
Or you have like a run report and it runs a report, it gives you aggregated data, but individual businesses' comments, as in individual businesses' top weakness.
biggest blocker, and then that becomes, we just print 10 of them off from where we go to that meeting.

Scott Markham - 28:01
Yep.
So what that's done is generated a summary.
So strong financial performance plus 25%.
I'm not going to read it all out here, but you've got questions for the next call, which could be questions for the next meeting or upcoming meeting.

Nick Siderfin - 28:21
Well, that's

Scott Markham - 28:24
No, this is a small advancement from our last time.
Yeah.

Nick Siderfin - 28:29
Recommended actions for the next 30 days,

Scott Markham - 28:31
which, again, could be for the next meeting.

dylan shaw - 28:34
That's a good point, actually.
We do want to capture actions.
So when we have this, when we have the meeting, there's going to be some actions that come out for every business.
We need to make sure they are captured

Scott Markham - 28:45
and stored against the business, don't

Shane McEwan - 28:49
we?
So we could have, yeah, we could have an

Scott Markham - 28:50
element in there, which you can type into to catch additional actions to recommended ones.
And then some inconsistence is trend break versus last month.
And then you can actually export that to

Nick Siderfin - 29:04
PDF.

Shane McEwan - 29:08
Really powerful liner.

Nick Siderfin - 29:15
It's got some potential, isn't it?
It's good, yeah.

Shane McEwan - 29:18
Definitely, I can see

dylan shaw - 29:21
Scott on his yacht now with the proceeds from UBT.

Shane McEwan - 29:25
That again.
I can see Scott on his yacht now and

dylan shaw - 29:28
he sells this back to UBT as a product.

Nick Siderfin - 29:32
Yeah, you're welcome to join

Scott Markham - 29:35
me.
And as

Nick Siderfin - 29:40
I think, and as I said to before, is watch the trends, watch the trends.

Scott Markham - 29:45
So yeah, you've got, you can either look at the company on its own, which these are not that pretty just yet, but it, I need to sort of make them a little bit more, not just dots because they're a little bit, and you've got some options there.
You can export the data further.
So you've got it in Excel.

Nick Siderfin - 30:17
And then

Scott Markham - 30:18
if you go back to the portfolio, you can see the portfolio company, so that could be all your 19 companies.
And then you can compare two against each other if you wanted to.
Or you can look at a heat map for the show you their scores and how they're performing.

dylan shaw - 30:40
Can you do a heat map by month?
That's,

Scott Markham - 30:43
yeah, that's the next thought I had in my head.

Nick Siderfin - 30:48
So yeah, this is

Scott Markham - 30:50
just sort of how far I've got this week.
But that's why I can take what I've got from you today and fine tune so that it's more specific for what you are wanting from next week.
That makes sense.

dylan shaw - 31:10
Yeah, that's good.

Nick Siderfin - 31:19
We

dylan shaw - 31:20
have been for a long time, Nick.
Oh,

Nick Siderfin - 31:21
sorry.

Scott Markham - 31:26
Sorry.
Yeah, that's good.
I'm glad to be part of it.

dylan shaw - 31:31
You reocating the

Nick Siderfin - 31:33
gut.
Let's not go that far, Nick.

Scott Markham - 31:37
So, yeah, you can do a full AI summary for the whole portfolio as well.
I

dylan shaw - 31:46
think this is really good.
It's super powerful.
Slight because slight worry is that I just don't want to overface people when we send out.
So probably if we can do a kind of if we can turn some of the stuff off so that we

Nick Siderfin - 32:01
only give them what we need them to fill

Scott Markham - 32:05
Otherwise it'll become a bit of an elephant that they

dylan shaw - 32:07
don't do before Friday next week.

Scott Markham - 32:12
Fine.
I think if we did do a,

Nick Siderfin - 32:15
you might say a little cover letter and say, look, this is the advantage of doing this.
We reckon it'll take you 10 minutes to do it.
And the advantages of XYZ.

dylan shaw - 32:28
Is it worth that if we're going if we want all of that filling in, do we not need to have like almost like a meeting with all the businesses Zoom or whatever?
in an evening early next week to say, right, we just want to demo this tool is, which we want to use for Friday.
To collect the data to get their buy- in.

Nick Siderfin - 32:55
don't know.
Up Scott's story, things about that.

Scott Markham - 33:03
Yeah, who's demoing

Nick Siderfin - 33:06
You.
Who

Scott Markham - 33:12
Let me, um, yeah, I'm, I'm sure I should be able to do that.
I just need to, once I've got that bits and pieces from you, as soon as possible, please.
Um, see how, how I, how develops into something that can easily be shared that they're going to feel comfortable with.

dylan shaw - 33:29
Or the other way around is actually just do a recording we send out.

Scott Markham - 33:35
So you almost like do a bit of an overview of it.

Nick Siderfin - 33:37
Yeah, exactly.

Scott Markham - 33:42
Yep.
I could do like a, yeah, I could do that, yeah.
With what they need to do, what it will show, what they'll see.
Yeah,

dylan shaw - 33:51
simplest.
And then

Scott Markham - 33:53
they can look at it in their own time and play at double speed if they want to, or go back to it, can't they?

Nick Siderfin - 33:57
Yeah, just keep it pretty succinct and brief, I guess.

Scott Markham - 34:04
Cut the waffle, yeah.
Fine.

dylan shaw - 34:08
So just summarize then, do a bit action points from what we're doing so we're clear.
So just made some bullet point notes.
There's probably loads that I've missed, but capture actions from the meeting.
We've got somewhere we can just add an action against the business.
If we come up with a good idea in the meeting, we say, right, we're going to do this by before the next meeting.
We've got somewhere doing that.
Summary report, which shows aggregated data, but individuals, businesses, comments

Nick Siderfin - 34:38
on blockers and opportunities, et

Scott Markham - 34:39
cetera.
logging by business

dylan shaw - 34:44
and it remembers the data if someone else in that business has filled it in.
And then confidentiality in that only the business logging can see their own individual data, but the summary only shows you summary reporting only shows aggregated data.

Scott Markham - 35:03
Is

dylan shaw - 35:03
there anything else that we've said that I've captured?

Scott Markham - 35:09
From my side, it's just also just in, um, uploading the data that you've already got.

dylan shaw - 35:14
Yeah, um, for an action from

Scott Markham - 35:17
you used to share that as, as you can, as soon as possible.
And that PowerPoint too.
So, yeah,

dylan shaw - 35:25
I've, I've emailed that.
You should have that.
Brilliant.
So you've got the, for the logo, is that?

Scott Markham - 35:31
The logo and those questions that you, were important to you.

dylan shaw - 35:35
Yeah.
And what, what are we saying about the stuff that, are we saying we want to fill, get everybody to fill all of this in, or are we going to turn some of it Or do we wait until you've built it and then look

Nick Siderfin - 35:47
at it.
I think, but I don't think it's that difficult.
But there might be a couple of questions where, as we say, it's not, not applicable what, so they can opt out of that if they want to.

Scott Markham - 36:02
Yeah.
Why don't we see what

Shane McEwan - 36:04
it all comes out like, Dill?
Yeah.
When one scotts other two over it all.

dylan shaw - 36:11
Yeah.
If we can capture the value of having

Shane McEwan - 36:14
that score is going really good.
And the

dylan shaw - 36:18
sooner we can start mapping that, the sooner

Shane McEwan - 36:21
we'll get the value out of it, won't Yeah.
Going forward.

dylan shaw - 36:27
What about the KPI questions?
What

Nick Siderfin - 36:34
do you mean?
So on the

dylan shaw - 36:36
Microsoft form, we put in, because we're trying to capture a common KPI.
We asked them, the businesses, what of this list of KPIs, which would you be, which do you track?
So we were trying to kind of get to a position where we could start capturing one metric across every business.

Nick Siderfin - 36:58
Yeah, we're talking about the lead measures.
I suppose this is more a lack measure, isn't it?
Yeah,

dylan shaw - 37:05
that score that's coming out of that sheet of yours is a bit of a lag, isn't it?
It's a bit

Nick Siderfin - 37:12
a... It's a review mirror of how the business is performing month on month.
Yeah, the

dylan shaw - 37:17
lead measures, I would have thought it had to be a separate

Nick Siderfin - 37:20
program at the moment.
Well, yeah, it's bit and bit,

Scott Markham - 37:23
isn't it?
The multiple choice questions are kind lead.
The figures are lag.

dylan shaw - 37:32
What we're trying to get to Scott was something that we could actually have an impact on a monthly basis.
So if our numbers started dipping, we could say rally everyone and say, right, we need to ramp up our telemarketing here.
We numbers are going down.
Let's see if we can aggregate hit 20,000 next month.

Scott Markham - 37:50
And that kind of gave you something tangible that you could

dylan shaw - 37:52
get your teeth into it from every business's point of view.

Scott Markham - 37:56
Yeah, but are you still gathering that one KPI though?

dylan shaw - 37:59
No, we haven't, we haven't started because we just, the starting point was just asking the question to people to say, what, what metric are you already tracking that we can

Scott Markham - 38:08
sort of commonly tap into?
Yeah.
But you're starting to get that feedback or not?

Shane McEwan - 38:15
There is, there is a bit of a trend there, Bill,

dylan shaw - 38:18
just looking at In terms of outbound

Shane McEwan - 38:20
calls and first orders stroke new accounts.

dylan shaw - 38:25
Why don't we just decide on that then?
And so that's what we're going to track.
Because you'll have enough data there from what people have already responded to know that that's what that's probably going to be the most common thing, isn't

Shane McEwan - 38:38
Yeah.
So you've already got that

Nick Siderfin - 38:42
log pendulum.
I've got the log, yeah, but

Shane McEwan - 38:44
we haven't got any data yet because it was just a question.

Scott Markham - 38:49
We can include on this form now, can't Yeah, just make

dylan shaw - 38:52
it your multiple choice to say dials or outbound calls.
Like you're capturing the Ebit dial just the same.

Scott Markham - 39:02
Yeah.
That would be really good, because as soon as you start

dylan shaw - 39:05
getting monthly data on that aggregate,

Nick Siderfin - 39:09
that's going to be really good.

Shane McEwan - 39:11
And most, in reality, most outbound calls and first orders are generally pretty easy to report

dylan shaw - 39:17
on, aren't they?
Yeah.
Well, I would have thought any of the sort of any of the businesses more than a one-- one man band are probably doing it anyway, they?

Shane McEwan - 39:27
Yeah, I would imagine so, yeah.
Might be a jogger to do it if they're not.

dylan shaw - 39:33
Yeah, definitely an incentive

Nick Siderfin - 39:36
to do it.
Yeah.

dylan shaw - 39:43
Can we have the strap line as well from the PowerPoint?

Scott Markham - 39:47
Yeah.

dylan shaw - 39:51
That's good.

Nick Siderfin - 39:55
Excellent.

dylan shaw - 39:59
Thank

Nick Siderfin - 40:00
you, Scott.
Appreciate

dylan shaw - 40:10
it.
